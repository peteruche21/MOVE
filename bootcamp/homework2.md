## features of the blockchain that matter to me the most

- finality time, how do we make sure that the transaction is final and forever stamped on the blockchain? this is determined by the finality. while so many blockchains may not give muc preference to this, it remains a major leap that must be present if the blockchain technology can be able to handle more usecases especially in areas related in onchain gaming and payments.

- security: this is the most important. if a blockchain is not secure then it is not useable.

- tps: the only way to lower the barrier of entry is through the fee model, i personally won't easily adopt a technology that i will worry about cost's when i want to perform a transaction. and mostly, the fees are determined based on the tps.
