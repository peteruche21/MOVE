## if i am building an onchain game

- finality would affect the efficiency of how the games works
- throughput (tps) would affect it because if the games exceeds the thresholds then it affects the gaming experience
- gas fees, assuming the cost of a single transaction is high, the game would not be profitable
- batched transactions: if the games could execute multiple transactions at once then it would be a better experience

## benefits of decentralization

- provable computation
- digital assets and asset tokenization
- less intermediation
- anonymity
- privacy
- truth

## 2 most important features of a blockchain to me

- security
- hight throughput (enable lower gas costs);
